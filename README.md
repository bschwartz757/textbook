Working Title: JavaScript for the Web Savvy
===========================================

There aren't a lot of good JavaScript textbooks out there, so I'm writing one. HTML/CSS source starts in the /src folder, and gets output after templating and LESS compilation to the /build folder. It's a work in progress, so mind the dust.

You can view a recent (but not cutting edge) version of the output by visiting: http://thomaswilburn.github.com/textbook

This project no longer includes built files in the repo. If you want to edit a local copy, the included Gruntfile will start a dev server with live reload. Make sure to install its dependencies from NPM first.
